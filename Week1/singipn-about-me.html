                    Throughout my elementary school years, extensive exposure to the concepts of chemical reactions increased my curiosity about how these reactions occur and how they can be manipulated to produce useful products. From the disappearance of pink color during titration activity to consistent efforts in analyzing various salts, my abilities and knowledge have grown by leaps and bounds. My grasping abilities aided me in establishing a stronghold over other conceptual subjects through meticulous efforts and consistent hard work. I aced my senior secondary with a 96.9 percent aggregate score and advanced to the top 1 percentile of students in JEE, one of the world's most difficult physics-chemistry-mathematics-based exams. This ultimately resulted in my admission to the Bachelor of Technology in Chemical Engineering program at the National Institute of Technology Warangal, one of India's most prestigious engineering institutions.

                    I started out as a chemical engineering student, but realized early on that chemical engineering was not my true calling in life. Not wanting to settle for a career path that did not resonate with me, I hustled in college to pursue my passions and became involved in a variety of college activities ranging from event planning and management to internships in techno-managerial roles. I discovered my potential and interest in technology and decided against all odds to prepare myself to learn the skills necessary to become a techno-managerial professional.

                    Throughout my undergraduate studies, I participated in a variety of co-curricular activities that helped me develop a sense of maturity and professionalism and assisted me in developing a confident persistent persona. Apart from my studies, I took great pride in leading the NITW Astronomy Club, which helped me develop my leadership skills and discipline, and persistence.
                </p>

                    I was fortunate to discover my potential and interest in techno-managerial roles and decided to prepare for the industry against all odds. I applied laterally to various organizations and landed one of my dream jobs as a Software Developer at Zenoti India Private Limited. I worked on projects that provided me with valuable insight into prominent technical and management positions, as well as cutting-edge computer technologies.

                    While my experience thus far has afforded me ample opportunity to study the intricacies of research and application, I intend to broaden my horizons through the Business Administration (Information Systems) program at the University of Cincinnati in order to gain practical experience and skills. The very reason for selecting the University of Cincinnati is due to the widespread recognition and reputation of its faculty members. I value the academic culture and history that it entails. It fills me with pride and accomplishment to be a part of your scholarly community and to ensure a strong foundation for myself in academia and the technology industry.. I am convinced that the imposing foundation of the University of Cincinnati will provide me with comprehensive guidance in terms of high-quality research and ample opportunities for realizing my dreams.
